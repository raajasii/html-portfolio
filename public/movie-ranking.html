<h1>The best movie list by Rajasi</h1>
 
 
 <p>I am not a big fan of binge watching movies but these are some of the best movies that i really enjoyed and would recommend</p>
 
<hr/>
<h2>1. Jab We Met(hindi)</h2>
<p>one of the best rom-com movies that deserves a watch . it taught me about how relationships and love can be beautiful and simple </p>
 <br/>
 <h2>2.Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara(hindi)</h2>
 <p>three friends go on a trip to fulfil the promises they made while they were in high school. a typical friend trip that we need as we get busy with our careers and jobs. wonderful movie!</p>
